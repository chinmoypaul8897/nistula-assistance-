# progress.md — Nistula Assistance · Build Log

> **The session-memory layer.** Every chunk session: read plan.md §1–§3 first, then this file top to bottom, then your assigned chunk in plan.md §8. Every chunk session ENDS by appending an entry here using the plan.md §9 template. If it's not written here, the next session doesn't know it happened.

## Status

- **Current chunk pointer:** CH-00 (repo bootstrap) — next up, not started.
- **Env values:** none exist yet anywhere. Secrets live in `credentials-local/` (gitignored, root) until they move to local `.env` + Railway variables. `credentials-local/` must NEVER be committed or copied into docs/.
- **How to run:** nothing to run yet — no package.json until CH-00.

### Pre-CH · Orientation & repo organisation — DONE 2026-07-07

**Built:**
- Organised the raw planning inputs into the plan.md §3.2 layout: `product-picture.md` → `docs/product-picture.md`, voice guide → `kb/source/voice-guide.md` (the exact path CH-04 requires), `ezee api/` → `docs/ezee/`.
- Pulled the credentials folder OUT of the eZee docs and to root as `credentials-local/` (renamed from "Private Secure Folder Credentials (Never Coomit on Git )") so the docs tree is clean and the ignore rule is exact.
- Created `.gitignore` before any git activity (plan §3.6: gitignore first, always) covering `.env*`, `credentials-local/`, `CREDENTIALS.md`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `*.dump`.
- Created this progress.md with the chunk ledger and status header.

**Decisions made while building:**
- This folder (`c:\Users\chinm\nistula assistance code`) is treated as the repo root itself — CH-00 will `git init` here and add the GitHub remote, rather than creating a nested `nistula-assistance/` folder. Reason: everything is already laid out here in repo shape; nesting would duplicate.
- Credentials folder renamed to `credentials-local/` for a clean, exactly-matchable gitignore entry. Contents untouched.

**Observed reality:**
- Machine: Node **v24.14.1** (plan pins Node 22 LTS — see Open questions), git 2.43, Docker 29.4 present. **pnpm NOT installed** — CH-00 must start with `corepack enable` (or `npm i -g pnpm`).
- eZee docs mirror is large (~2 MB total; `ezee_connectivity_api_FULL.md` alone ~1 MB). Chunk sessions should read only the file their chunk names (`04_bookings.md` for CH-10), never the FULL file wholesale.
- Root path contains spaces (`nistula assistance code`) — always quote paths in shell commands.

**Deviations from plan.md:** none (no code yet). File placement follows §3.2 exactly.

**Open questions:**
1. Node version: machine has v24 (current LTS), plan says 22 LTS. Recommendation: build on 24 and pin `"engines": {"node": ">=22"}` — nothing in the stack is version-sensitive between 22 and 24. Paul to confirm at CH-00.
2. Folder name has spaces and differs from the repo name `nistula-assistance`. Works fine, but if Paul prefers renaming the folder to `nistula-assistance`, do it BEFORE CH-00 (before git init / Railway wiring).

**How to verify:** `ls` the root — should show exactly `plan.md`, `progress.md`, `.gitignore`, `credentials-local/`, `docs/`, `kb/`. `kb/source/voice-guide.md` and `docs/ezee/00_INDEX.md` exist.
